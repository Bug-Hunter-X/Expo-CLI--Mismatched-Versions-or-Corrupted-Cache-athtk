This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed locally and the version required by your project.  It might also arise from corrupted cache files or incomplete installations. Let's explore solutions.

```javascript
// Example code snippet where the error might occur (within a project file):
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is an Expo App</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```
