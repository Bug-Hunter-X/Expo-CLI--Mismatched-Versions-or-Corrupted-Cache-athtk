The solution involves several steps to address potential version mismatches and corrupted cache.  Here's how to fix the issue:

1. **Check Expo CLI Version:**
```bash
expo --version
```

2. **Clear Expo Cache:**
```bash
expo cache:clear
```

3. **Reinstall Expo CLI (If Necessary):**
```bash
npm uninstall -g expo-cli
npm install -g expo-cli
```

4. **Update project dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
``` or 
```bash
yarn install
```

After performing these steps, attempt to rebuild your project using `expo start`. The issue should be resolved.
